## Time Management

- There is only 1 week to complete the project. Since everybody is new in the project and we are still learning to work together made the development flow slower than expected.

## Communication

- Slack is used to communicate between the team with regular meetings. Working remotely and not being available at the same time made difficult to communicate on time.

## Availability

- Team power is less than expected. 2 members  of the team do not have internet connection, and 1 of the team member was sick.
